# COMP 3005 Project v2

## Setup instructions
1. Clone repository from Github to local: https://github.com/lisaw-bbqsauce/comp3005project

## How to run
1. Open terminal in project workspace
1. Run (if in VS code: F5)

### Notes
I run the initial SQL queries in the program, so no need to set that up. Just run main and the database should be set up for you!

Do update the port and username + password at the top of Main.java if they differ to yours.

If you are having trouble setting up the database you can run the queries manually in pgAdmin:
1. Copy + paste the contents of `01.0.sql` into a query editor in pgAdmin
1. Run!
